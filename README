This is a cookie law plugin for Joomla, adapted for use in Slovenia.

The plugin has been adapted from Channel Computing, redistributed with their permission. The plugin has been upgraded to be in actual compliance with EU law (opt-in approach).

The plugin will block javascript-based cookie creators, however because iframe-based cookie creators cannot easily be controlled as of yet, you must exclude their display from the code in order to maintain compliance. You may do so by encasing the PHP code to display the content within the following IF block:

	if($_COOKIE['cookieAcceptanceCookie'] == "accepted") {

		/* YOUR IFRAME DEFENITION HERE */

	}


HACKING

The code has a working build environment, if you make modifications to the code, use "make" to regenerate the installer packages.

The version folders contain files which are unique to the desired version. The ZIP files will include files from the "common" folder unless a file with the same name is present in the joomla version subfolder. These will then be packaged into the different Joomla installation packages appropriately.


INSTALL

If you simply wish to use these plugins, see the ZIP files in the "install" folder. These may be installed directly into Joomla as extensions. Please check with the joomla community if you are unsure which package is appropriate for your Joomla version.
